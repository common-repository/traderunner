= About Trade Runner =

Trade Runner is a plugin that will list products from your store on the www.trademe.co.nz marketplace. Any sales from Trade Me will be sent back to your WooCommerce store for fulfilment.

When you install Trade Runner, it will import products from your store and you can choose which products you want to list on Trade Me.

Products are kept up to date with automated syncing between WooCommerce, Trade Runner and Trade Me.

You can also make changes to your products in Trade Runner without changing them in your store. This means that you can have a different price or product title on Trade Me to your store.

Orders from Trade Me are sent through to your store for easy fulfilment with your existing processes.

= Key Features =

Product and Inventory Syncing â€“ Trade Runner keeps your products and inventory in sync with automated syncs between WooCommerce, Trade Runner and Trade Me.

Prevent Overselling - If you carry shallow stock you can also add a stock buffer.

Use your existing fulfilment processes - Orders are sent through to your store and inventory updated when you make a sale on Trade Me. Add the tracking code and carrier in your store when the order is fulfilled and the order is then updated on Trade Me.

Optimize Products for Trade Me - You can change the price, title and description of products for Trade Me without making changes to the products in your store.
